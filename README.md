# Firestorm-2.0
A sound reactive screensaver with insects that respond to sound input for macOS.  Back in 2006 this was something that had never been done before.  I've included the files that I used to create the installer package and the disk image artwork.  If you have an older version of OSX from 2006 or 2007 you should be able to open the Package Installer file that I use to create the installer.  Keep in mind that you'll also need the Apple Developer tools for that version of macOS.

As of 2017 this will install and run on atleast OSX El Capitan 10.11.6.  It may run above that so your millage may vary.
