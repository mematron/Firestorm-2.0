# Firestorm-2.0
A sound reactive screensaver with insects that respond to sound input for macOS.  Back in 2006 this was something that had never been done before.  It was published in a popular magazine and was on Apple's top 10 software list for over a year. I've included the files that I used to create the installer package and the disk image artwork.  If you have an older version of OSX between 2006 and 2011 you'll be able to open the Installer source with Package Maker.  Keep in mind that you'll also need the Apple Developer tools for that version of macOS.

As of 2017 this will install and run on atleast OSX El Capitan 10.11.6.  It may run in higher versions but it has not been tested.  I suspect that this application is future proof since I played nice and didn't use any undocumented libraies or plugins.

I've included a video of Firestorm 2.0 in action and a standalone application.

Finally, the source for this application is included called "Firestorm 2.qtz" file  You'll need Xcode installed to view the source.
